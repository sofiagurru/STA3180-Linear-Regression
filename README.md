The data set, “Hikes”, provides various measurements of the forty-six mountains in the Adirondacks of upstate New York. They are known as the High Peaks with elevations near or above 4000 feet. Researchers would like to find a regression model for the expected Time (in hours) to hike these peaks using the variables: Elevation (in feet), Ascent (in feet), Difficulty (on a 1-7 scale with 7 being the most difficult) and Length (of roundtrip in miles).

The researchers would like to fit a simple linear regression model, so they must decide which of the four explanatory variables to select. First, create a correlation matrix using the four explanatory variables and the response variable. Next, create four separate scatterplots with one for each of the four explanatory variables with the response variable. Use the information in the correlation matrix and the scatterplots to recommend to the researchers which variable would be their best choice to predict Time.
